# Sprouter
## Rochelle Roberts <br>


## Description
Sprouter is an Android journaling app for plant lovers to document the growth and life of their plants. New growth! I created this app to explore React and to combine my love of plants with my passion for programming.


## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
For Sprouter to be a useful journalling app, the following specifications define the MVP.
* 
* 
* A user can add notes about their plants.
* A user can have multiple plant journals and see the notes for a particular plant.
* 

## Beyond MVP
* It would be ideal if users can upload pictures of their plants to go along with the text.
* Host app
* Limit image size  -- or total image sizes
* Cost and scalability analysis
* Responsive UI design
* Mobile friendly
* PC to phone sync
* Accessibility 
* Users can have multiple “books/channels” for journaling about each plant. 
* User authentication
* Make app work well on mobile --- styling for different screen sizes.
* Add tags for user to search their plants
* Make stories for plants, like before and after to show plant growth.
* Connect with Google Photos 
* Add reminders --- twilio API to send texts or emails.
* Create outdoor plant tag that is linked with weather API
